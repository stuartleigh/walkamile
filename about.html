								<p><span class="fatboyslim">Walk a Mile In My Shoes</span> is an educational and therapeutic arts project in which young people from <a href="http://www.kidsco.org.uk" target="_blank">Kids Company</a> were given the opportunity to create two sculptures, using a pair of Nike Air Force 1 trainers as their starting point, to visually represent their physical or metaphorical life journey. </p>
								<p>The shoe-sculptures symbolise the paths they have trodden, and hope to tread in life. One of the pair was created with the design brief: <strong>'Where have I come from?'</strong> and the other with the design brief: <strong>'Where am I going?'</strong></p>
								<p>With their <strong>'Where have I come from?'</strong> sculpture, the young people used various artistic techniques to represent challenges they have faced to date, emotions they have struggled to express verbally, or simply a physical place they associate with. </p>
								<p>With their <strong>'Where am I going?'</strong> sculpture, the young people were asked to dare to document their hopes and aspirations for their future. Together, these two sculptures acknowledge the young people's experiences to date and affirm to the world their intentions for a brighter future.</p>
                                <p>The <span class="fatboyslim">Walk a Mile In My Shoes</span> workshops were held over the course of 2011 at <a href="http://www.kidsco.org.uk" target="_blank">Kids Company's</a> educational facility, <a href="http://www.urbanacademy.org.uk" target="_blank">The Urban Academy</a>. Led by artist <span class="pink">Taz</span>, the young people participated in a discussion on branding and communicating ideas visually. They created mood boards, and project plans for their sculptures and learnt new practical art techniques. They also participated in a professional photo shoot to document their work, with photographer <a href="http://www.aramintadeclermont.com" target="_blank">Araminta De Clermont</a>, at <a href="http://www.irisstudios.co.uk" target="_blank">Iris Studios</a>. </p>

								<p>Artist and project leader, <span class="pink">Taz</span>, explains:</p>
								<p style="text-align:center"><em>'Our personal style, expressed through what we wear, is a reflection of all our experiences and influences to date, for good or bad. These outward expressions of who we are, who we want the world to see or what we aim to hide, are an insight into each individuals' inner world. <span class="fatboyslim">Walk a Mile In My Shoes</span> is an opportunity for these children, who have often faced unspeakable acts of cruelty, to share with us, through art, their inner world, the obstacles they have faced and what they visualise for themselves with the knowledge that they can and will overcome these obstacles.'</em></p>
                                <p>Artists <a href="http://www.celinateague.com/" target="_blank">Celina Teague</a>, <a href="http://lauracole-millinery.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Laura Cole</a>, <span class="pink">Taz</span> and <span class="fatboyslim">Walk A Mile In My Shoes</span> teaching assistant, <span class="pink">Vickie Biscoe</span>, have also contributed their own pair of shoe-sculptures, which can be viewed in the gallery, alongside the young people's shoe-sculptures.</p>
								<p><a href="http://www.kidsco.org.uk" target="_blank">Kids Company</a> and <span class="pink">Taz</span> ask you to browse the galleries of both the children's and contributor's shoe-sculptures and in doing so, walk the metaphorical mile in their shoes.</p>

								<p><a href="http://www.kidsco.org.uk" target="_blank"><span class="logoKids">&nbsp;</span></a> is a UK based charity, founded by Camila Batmanghelidjh in 1996, providing practical, emotional and educational support to 14,000 vulnerable, inner-city children.</p>
								<p>These exceptionally vulnerable children not only negotiate significant challenges in their family homes, they also face immense threat within their neighbourhoods. Often they are exposed to relentless violence, some are forced into working as drug couriers or prostitutes, and many experience chronic abuse.</p>
								<p><a href="http://www.kidsco.org.uk" target="_blank">Kids Company</a> provide a safe, caring, family environment where support is tailored to the needs of each individual child, at one of three street level centres and a therapy house. Here, the aim is to first stabilize each young person by meeting their practical needs, before helping them to address emotional and behavioural difficulties. Once the young person has achieved some sense of stability and calm, they are able to participate in a range of programmes that help them to identify their talents and interests and so develop aspirations for the future.</p>

								<p><span class="fatboyslim">Walk a Mile In My Shoes</span> is a project within the Arts programme at <a href="http://www.kidsco.org.uk" target="_blank">Kids Company</a>, which reaches 6000 children and young adults every year. It is the staff's experience at <a href="http://www.kidsco.org.uk" target="_blank">Kids Company</a>, that traumatised and lonely children struggle to verbalise their feelings and that art often becomes the most powerful, and only, means of expression for them, providing a window into their lives so that their needs to overcome their difficulties can be better understood and met.</p>
								<p>The initial <span class="fatboyslim">Walk a Mile In My Shoes</span> workshops will be held at <a href="http://www.urbanacademy.org.uk" target="_blank">The Urban Academy</a>, a <a href="http://www.kidsco.org.uk" target="_blank">Kids Company</a> street level centre in south east London. <a href="http://www.urbanacademy.org.uk" target="_blank">The Urban Academy</a> was established in 2005 and is a post-16 educational and life skills academy, supporting 220 young people, who have been rejected from other educational facilities due to their complex emotional or behavioural needs, to assist them in moving into university, college or employment.</p>
								<p>In 2007 <a href="http://www.kidsco.org.uk" target="_blank">Kids Company</a> was awarded the <em>Liberty and JUSTICE Human Rights Award.</em> In 2010 they were selected as a <em>'Child Poverty Champion'</em> by the <em>End Child Poverty project</em> for their success in enabling children to achieve their full potential.</p>

								<img src="images/taz_sm.jpg" alt="Taz Cambitzi" class="fltLeft" /><p><span class="pink">Taz</span> is a London based artist whose work focuses on redefining how we see and use fashion as a tool of self-expression. Her work has been featured in <em>GQ</em>, <em>Glamour</em>, <em>The Sunday Times Style supplement</em> and she has created footwear-art for musicians Nas, Chipmunk, Tinchy Stryder, Ne-Yo, Pretty Ricky and Ashley Walters. One of her pieces was also included in the <em>Hope for Haiti Now</em> auction in 2010. <span class="pink">Taz</span> has used items of clothing, shoes and accessories as her principal medium for the past eight years, seeing them as an effective way of communicating to the world who we are and what we stand for.</p>
								<p><span class="pink">Taz's</span> background has given her a special empathy with young people facing difficult circumstances in the home, school or social environment. She believes passionately in the power of art to heal and that a child's willingness to simply participate in any creative process, is the first courageous sign that they wish to overcome the obstacles they have faced.</p>

It is our responsibility, as creative people, to answer this call and provide opportunities for young people to engage in the arts and so begin the process of healing.'</em></p>
