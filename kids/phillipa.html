						"At this time in my life I was not happy and had nobody to love me. I was alone and didn't know why my mum went away and never called. My sister didn't want to talk to me and I didn't want to be around people. I locked myself away from the world. I was dying like the flowers, and the bad was crawling on me like the bugs on my sculpture."

						"I found someone to talk to and help me with getting to know myself and that was Annie, my best friend. She was always there when I needed someone to talk to. She gave me somewhere to live when I had nowhere to go. She gave me back life and so the flowers came to life again. When someone gives you their time it is like a cocoon where you can feel safe to become a butterfly."

					<h2>My <em>'Walk A Mile In My Shoes'</em> Experience</h2>

						"Taz and Vickie were great. They always made me feel welcome at class. When I was upset they made me feel better and I felt like I could always talk to them even though I never said much they would just know and would make it better. Taz made me see things a different way and that calmed me down a lot. Thank you for letting me do the workshops."
