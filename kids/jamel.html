					<h2><em>Where Have I Come From?</em>, 'Modern Warfare'</h2>
					<p>
						"My sculpture is about pain and hardship, it represents my struggle of growing up as a young black male, on a disadvantaged estate in South London where I felt socially isolated from the rest of the world and had to go against authorities in order to make ends meet. Everyday was a battle against everyone else and against my own guilt."

					<h2><em>Where Am I Going?</em>, 'Warrior Phoenix'</h2>
					<p>
						"Through my experience growing up, I've seen a lot of dark things which made me die inside as a person, so I had to use the power and courage I used to fight authority, to face new challenges and go against the trend on my estate instead. It takes courage to adapt to anything that is thrown my way."

					<h2>My <em>'Walk A Mile In My Shoes'</em> Experience</h2>
					<p>
                        "This project has been a great influence and has helped me develop my creative side and has given me the opportunity to explore different ideas and bring them to life. I have had so much fun working with Taz and the rest of the group. It has been inspirational, and this project has opened my eyes and has unlocked a secret talent I didn't even know I had. I am an artist too."
