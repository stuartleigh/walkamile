					<h2><em>Where Have I Come From?</em>, 'Stitching The Gaps'</h2>

						"My sculpture is all about me being a fashion student with no money trying to better my life. At that time in my life, I lived in a shared house with very little money, so sewing was a way to keep me going. That's what the pennies on the base are for. The bright colours are the bright 80's clothing that I used to make for myself to save money, plus I never saw anyone in my outfits, maybe that wasn't a good thing?! This sculpture was everything I was about at that time - no money, but living life in living colour."

						"This sculpture is all about my rise to fame and becoming one of the great designers of my time, being able to sell all over the world, doing fashion week, but most of all being able to live off my art."

                        "One of the really good things about this project is you get to look inside yourself and find the good within you, which not only helps you to work, but most of all, makes you feel really good about yourself. It made me see trainers in a completely different way and I now realise to be a fashion designer, I must be an artist first."
